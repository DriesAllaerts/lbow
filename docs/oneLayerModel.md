# One-Layer Models

In this section, the solution to equation {eq}`eqn:characteristic_eqn` is derived for various one layer models, i.e., models consisting of one layer with uniform background wind speed and buoyancy frequency. The flow perturbation is triggered by the bottom boundary condition, which represents a topographical feature. One-dimensional models consider topography that only varies in one direction (e.g., a mountain ridge). Two-dimensional models consider topography that varies in two directions (e.g., an isolated mountain). Depending on the upper boundary condition, different models, different models exist.
