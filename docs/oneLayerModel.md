# One-Layer Models

In this section, the solution to equation {eq}`eqn:characteristic_eqn` is derived for various one layer models, i.e., models consisting of one layer with uniform background wind speed and buoyancy frequency. The flow perturbation is triggered by the bottom boundary condition, which represents a topographical feature. The difference between the models stems from the upper boundary condition.
