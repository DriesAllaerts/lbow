# LBoW Theory
This Jupyter Book describes the theory and mathematical expressions behind the python package [LBoW](https://github.com/DriesAllaerts/lbow). The theory is based on linear theory of stratified flow, which can be found in many textbooks {cite}`gossard_waves_1975, gill_atmosphere-ocean_1982, baines_topographic_1995, nappo_introduction_2002`. The general form of linear theory is derived in {numref}`Section %s <sec:LinearTheory>` for the sake of completeness. The dispersion equation and the vertical wave number are discussed in detail in {numref}`Section %s <sec:verticalWaveNumber>`. Next, {numref}`Section %s <sec:OneLayerModel>` describes various solutions to linear theory assuming that there is one layer with a uniform background wind speed and buoyancy frequency.
