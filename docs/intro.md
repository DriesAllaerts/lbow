# LBoW Theory
The aim of this text is to describe the theory and mathematical expressions behind the python package LBoW. The theory is based on linear theory of stratified flow, which can be found in many textbooks {cite}`gossard_waves_1975, gill_atmosphere-ocean_1982, baines_topographic_1995, nappo_introduction_2002`. The general form of linear theory is derived in {numref}`Section %s <sec:LinearTheory>` for the sake of completeness. {numref}`Section %s <sec:OneLayerModel>` describes two solutions to linear theory assuming that there is one layer with a uniform background wind speed and buoyancy frequency.
