  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Recent research suggests that atmospheric gravity waves can affect offshore wind-farm performance. A fast wind-farm boundary layer model has been proposed to simulate the effects of these gravity waves on wind-farm operation by {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx2"{$>$}Allaerts and Meyers{$<$}/a{$>$} ({$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx2"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}). The current work extends the applicability of that model to free atmospheres in which wind and stability vary with altitude. We validate the model using reference cases from literature on mountain waves. Analysis of a reference flow shows that internal gravity-wave resonance caused by the atmospheric non-uniformity can prohibit perturbations in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) at the wavelengths where it occurs. To determine the overall impact of the vertical variations in the atmospheric conditions on wind-farm operation, we consider 1 year of operation of the Belgian\textendash Dutch wind-farm cluster with the extended model. We find that this impact on individual flow cases is often of the same order of magnitude as the total flow perturbation. In 16.6 \% of the analyzed flows, the relative difference in upstream velocity reduction between uniform and non-uniform free atmospheres is more than 30 \%. However, this impact is small when averaged over all cases. This suggests that variations in the atmospheric conditions should be taken into account when simulating wind-farm operation in specific atmospheric conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The stratified hydrostatic flow over a bell-shaped isolated mountain is examined using linear theory. Solutions for various parts of the flow field are obtained using analytical and numerical Fourier analysis. The flow aloft is composed of vertically propagating mountain waves. The maximum amplitude of these waves occurs directly over the mountain but there is also considerable wave energy trailing downstream along the parabolas y2 = Nzax/U Near the ground, the asymmetric pressure field causes the incoming streamlines to split to avoid the mountain and this lateral deflection persists downstream. The horizontal divergence associated with this lateral deflection is balanced by the descent of potentially warmer air from aloft. The relationship of linear theory to other three-dimensional models is discussed. The approach to the two-dimensional infinite ridge limit and non-hydrostatic effects are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The effect of a sharp low-level temperature inversion on flow over a mountain is investigated via a series of two-dimensional idealized numerical model simulations. The main focus of the study is the effect of the inversion on the formation of lee waves, lee-wave rotors, low-level hydraulic jumps and the occurrence of wave breaking aloft. The idealized problem considered consists of an upwind velocity profile that is independent of height (above the boundary layer) and directed normal to an isolated two-dimensional ridge. The upstream stratification consists of a neutral layer immediately above the ground capped by a sharp temperature inversion. Above this, the atmosphere is stably stratified and the Brunt\textendash V\"ais\"al\"a frequency is independent of height. Simulations were conducted for a range of inversion strengths (measured by the difference in potential temperature across the inversion) and inversion heights. The effect of both a free-slip and a no-slip lower boundary condition is investigated. Results show that, when the upwind Froude number (defined in the usual way for two-layer shallow-water flow) falls below a critical value, a short-wavelength resonant lee wave forms downwind of the mountain on the inversion. It is shown that both the critical Froude-number value and the wavelength of the lee wave are accurately predicted by linear theory. The lee-wave amplitude, however, can be significantly underestimated by linear theory if the wavelength is less than the hill length scale. In the case of a no-slip boundary condition, if the wave amplitude is sufficiently large, boundary-layer separation occurs underneath the wave crests and closed rotor circulations occur. In general, flow separation (and rotors) do not occur in the free-slip case. In both the free-slip and no-slip flows, as the Froude number decreases the lee wave is eventually replaced by a stationary hydraulic jump above the lee slope of the mountain.
