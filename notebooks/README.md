# Notebooks
The use of the LBoW package is demonstrated by means of jupyter notebooks. The following example notebooks are available:
- [Surface corrugation](1-steady-state--surface-corrugation.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a sinusoidal surface corrugation.
- [Witch of Agnesi](2-steady-state--witch-of-Agnesi) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a bell-shaped hill (known as the Witch of Agnesi).
- [Trapped wave](3-steady-state--trapped-wave-solution) notebook, showing the impact of an artificial rigid lid on downward wave reflections.
- [Impulse response](4-transient--impulse-response) notebook, illustrating the temporal evolution of buoyancy waves by approximating the impulse reponse.
- [Transition to steady state](5-transient--step-function) notebook, illustrating the transition from unperturbed flow to a steady state buoyancy wave field.
