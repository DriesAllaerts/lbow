# LBoW example notebooks
The use of the LBoW package is demonstrated by means of jupyter notebooks. The following example notebooks are available:
- One-dimensional perturbations (ridge lines)
  - Steady state flow problems
    - [Surface corrugation](1-1D-steady-state--surface-corrugation.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a sinusoidal surface corrugation.
    - [Witch of Agnesi](2-1D-steady-state--witch-of-Agnesi.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a bell-shaped hill (known as the Witch of Agnesi).
    - [Trapped wave](3-1D-steady-state--trapped-wave-solution.ipynb) notebook, showing the impact of an artificial rigid lid on downward wave reflections.
  - Transient flow problems
    - [Impulse response](4-1D-transient--impulse-response.ipynb) notebook, illustrating the temporal evolution of buoyancy waves by approximating the impulse reponse.
    - [Transition to steady state](5-1D-transient--step-function.ipynb) ("step function") notebook, illustrating the transition from unperturbed flow to a steady state buoyancy wave field.
- Two-dimensional perturbations (isolated mountain)
  - Steady state flow problems
    - [Isolated bell-shaped mountain](6-2D-steady-state--bell-shaped-mountain.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a two-dimensional bell-shaped mountain
    - [Isolated bell-shaped mountain (hydrostatic)](7-2D-steady-state--bell-shaped-mountain-hydrostatic.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a two-dimensional bell-shaped mountain under the hydrostatic assumption.
