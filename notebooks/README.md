# LBoW example notebooks
The use of the LBoW package is demonstrated by means of jupyter notebooks. The following example notebooks are available:
- Steady state flow problems
  - [Surface corrugation](steady-state--1-surface-corrugation.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a sinusoidal surface corrugation.
  - [Witch of Agnesi (uniform)](steady-state--2-witch-of-Agnesi.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform, stratified flow over a bell-shaped hill (known as the Witch of Agnesi).
  - [Trapped wave](steady-state--3-trapped-wave-solution.ipynb) notebook, showing the impact of an artificial rigid lid on downward wave reflections.
  - [Witch of Agnesi (CNBL)](steady-state--4-witch-of-Agnesi.ipynb) notebook, calculating the solution for uniform flow with a capping inversion and a free atmosphere over a bell-shaped hill (known as the Witch of Agnesi).
- Transient flow problems
  - [Impulse response](transient--1-impulse-response.ipynb) notebook, illustrating the temporal evolution of buoyancy waves by approximating the impulse reponse.
  - [Transition to steady state](transient--2-step-function.ipynb) ("step function") notebook, illustrating the transition from unperturbed flow to a steady state buoyancy wave field.
