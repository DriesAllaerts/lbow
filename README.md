# Linear Buoyancy Wave package (LBoW)
LBoW is a python package to solve Linear Buoyancy Wave problems.

See the `dev` branch for the latest code under development

## Requirements
The code runs from python 3.10, but highest version is recommended. The core python libraries of the package only depend on numpy. Demonstration of the package is done via jupyter notebooks and depends on jupyter and matplotlib.

## Installation
To install, run `pip install -e lbow` after cloning the repository (or `pip install -e .` from inside `/path/to/lbow`)

## Structure
In this repository you can find:
- `lbow/` directory containing the core python libraries
- `notebooks/` directory containing jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of the lbow package
