# LBoW TODO list

### Todo
- [ ] Check and improve example notebook for multiLayerModel
- [ ] Add theory for multiLayerModel to documentation
- [ ] Derive and implement solution to u and p for multiLayerModel
- [ ] Discuss vertical wave number and sign convention in separate section instead of in the half-plane model. We use the same sign convention in all model formulations, so this should be a separate section (maybe under general form of linear theory).
- [ ] Add Book license on first page?
- [ ] Update main README file to add link to documentation
