# LBoW TODO list

### Todo
- [ ] Check upstream behaviour (domain too small?)
- [ ] Implement hydrostatic approximation for 2D model
- [ ] To reproduce Smith's figure, rerun models with higher resolution (only 4 z levels so faster than current model with 51 z levels)
- [ ] Update README files with new model and new notebook
