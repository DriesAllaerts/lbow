# LBoW TODO list

### Todo
- [ ] Check and improve example notebook for multiLayerModel
- [ ] Add theory for multiLayerModel to documentation
- [ ] Derive and implement solution to u and p for multiLayerModel
- [ ] Do not allow discontinuities in U. Either U is constant, or U should be linearly increasing (see work by Koen Devesse)
